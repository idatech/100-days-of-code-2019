<h1>100 Days of Code - Log</h1> <hr>

<h2>Day 0: Saturday August 17, 2019 </h2>

<p>(Re)Heard about #100DaysOfCode challenge started by Alexander Kallaway and decided to join the movement.</p><br>

<p>Just read his website, joined his twitter, and made a twitter commit
The truth is I do not know how to use github, but I managed to fork <a href="https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code"> this</a> so I can (log) my daily journey <p><br>


<p>Todays Progress: learn how to use github
Thoughts: I just managed to create a new repository and deleting them. No much effort as I had some previous commited event with friends, going to the mall and pick up my package. It also rained. Enough excuses for the first day? :)</p><br>


<h2>Day 1: Sunday August 18, 2019 </h2>

<p>Practise on Github: I came across  easy to folllow guide on how to get started with github forked from <a href="https://github.com/maptime/getting-started-with-git-and-github"> Chris Henrick</a> , rather  <a href = "https://github.com/jkosoy?tab=repositories">Jaime Kosoy</a></p><br>

<p>Progress: I created a  <a href="https://github.com/LujiAnna/100-days-of-code-2019.git">new repo</a> by clicking 'Repositiories' then a green button at the top-right 'New'
Made a new file  <a href ="https://github.com/LujiAnna/100-days-of-code-2019/blob/master/README.md"> README.md </a> using command line (init, add, commit, remote add and push). Its an empty file.</p>

<p>I had made a folder in my desktop called 100-days-of-code-2019 so I can work from the (VS) editor. From terminal I changed to the folder using commands (cd, init, checkout, and touch), and created  README.md file (again) and log.md file describing a little and what to log (this is it). Which I will add on the branch, using commands (remote add branch, and the REPO-link). log was created but not 'this one' :) I have to repeat this so I can push this log and not an empty one.  <p><br>

<p>Cloning a (kallaway) repo: on his (100) repo, I took the SSH clone url on the right green button 'clone or download' and cloned it to the desktop using CL (cd, and git clone 100 100)
The created directory 100 clones the repo and adds a remote called "origin" back to the source. then made the git checkout or checkout - b develop to use during the development cycle (updating)<p><br>

<p>Now there is a git repo with 2 branches: master and develop</p>





<p>Thoughts:

Link to work: I created this new (Repo) just for (github)learning purposes</p>
