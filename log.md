<p>100 Days of Code - Log

Day 0: Saturday August 17, 2019 

(Re)Heard about #100DaysOfCode challenge started by Alexander Kallaway and decided to join the movement.

Just read his website, joined his twitter, and made a twitter commit
The truth is I do not know how to use github, but I managed to fork (https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) this so I can (log) my daily journey 


Todays Progress: learn how to use github
Thoughts: I just managed to create a new repository and deleting them. No much effort as I had some previous commited event with friends, going to the mall and pick up my package. It also rained. Enough excuses for the first day? :)


Day 1: Sunday August 18, 2019 

Practise on Github: I came across https://github.com/maptime/getting-started-with-git-and-github easy to folllow guide on how to get started with github forked from Chris Henrick , rather Jaime Kosoy (https://github.com/jkosoy?tab=repositories)

Progress: I created a new repo (https://github.com/LujiAnna/100-days-of-code-2019.git) 
Made a new file README.md (https://github.com/LujiAnna/100-days-of-code-2019/blob/master/README.md) using command line (init, add, commit, remote add and push)

I had made a folder in my desktop called 100-days-of-code-2019 so I can work from the (VS) editor. From terminal I changed to the folder using cd command, and created  README.md file (again) and log.md file describing what to do and what to log (this is it). Which I will add on the origin, using commands (remote add origin, and the REPO-link) 

Thoughts:

Link to work: I created this new (Repo) just for (github)learning purposes
